SQL Joins - cross join , self join , inner join

~~~
Sql Join - Inner Join : 

why not suing where clause instead of ON

CUSTOMER (CUSTID , CUSTNAME , LOCATION , PHONE)

101 raj kolkata 12345
102 raja mumbai 23456
103 rajat mumbai 23457
LOAN(LOANID , AMOUNT , DT_OF_LOAN , YEARS , CUSTID)

11 129090 12-12-2020 5 101 
12 128976 11-11-2021 3 102

Q. Find out customer's name and location who have taken loan 

Query ans - 
select c.custname , c.location 
from customer c inner join loan l 
on c.custid = l.custid;

ans - 
101 raj 
102 raha


we can also do it using sub queries 

if the table has 1 million and loan taken is only 10 k then 

it will take huge amount of time 

so we use sub query 

ans = 

select c.custname , c.location from customer c where c.custid IN
(select l.custid from loan l);

this is the concept of sub query we need to use IN in replace of = in case of sub query .


customers who have not taken loan 

select c.custname , c.location from customer c where c.custid not IN ( select l.custid from loan l );

~~~
Problem2

where day
~~~


~~~
Problem 4 

write a query to the count the number of customers who have registration but no account in the bank 

give the alias name as Count_Customer

ans - 
    select count(custid) as Count_Customer 
    from customer 
    where custid NOT IN(
      select cusid From account
    );


~~~

~~~
Problem 5 

ans - select custid , 
CONCAT (fanme ,' ',COALESCE(mname,ltname))
AS cust_name
FROM customer ;

COALESCE -- FUNCTION IF - THE FIRST VALUE IS MISSING THEN 
REPLACE THE VALUE WITH THE LAST NAME 

EXAMPLE 
COALESCE(mname , ltname)

then mname will be replaced by ltname if mname is not present

select e.name from employee e 
where e.salary > (select avg(a.salary) from employee a group by a.deptno where a.deptno = e.deptno )


**avg salary of the particular dept is concerned 

Corelated Subquery - when the inner query and outer query operations are dependent on each other and run parallely
